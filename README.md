Because it is such a huge task to learn the current front-end technologies, there is a large job market for these types of developers. [An entry level position is easily 60k/yr](http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=React.js/Salary). I mention this because during the learning process, you will constantly doubt your own intelligence, and find it hard to learn and digest. But everybody feels that way, so don't worry about it. The outcome of learning how to create modern web apps is amazing. It's gratifying to work in an industry where you are constantly challenged, where you can be creative, and where you can directly see the fruits of your labour. Not to mention the ability to work remotely.
